*Documentation of the project of the lecture *Modern Internet Technologies* in Winter 20-21*

# Introduction

This document offers an example of how to solve the exercises and start the project. The example project will be a THD App with focus on navigation created by a single developer. It will be published on MyGit (https://mygit.th-deg.de/).

The Wiki is the project documentation. The documentation is dynamic and may be extended and changed throughout the project.

Notice that the examples on MyGit are very basic. Please develop your own ideas and try out more things. The code you develop and the documentation must be self-written.
