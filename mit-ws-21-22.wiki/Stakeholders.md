Set up a list of the requests on which you will focus the project. Then think about possible Stakeholders and assign them to the requests.

E.g.

Requests with possible stakeholders from a brainstorm:

1. Corporate Identity (THD marketing group, Developer Frontend, User)
2. News (Users, THD press group, Developer)
3. Navigation (Guests, Staff, THD ITZ, Developer)
4. Registered Area (All users, Developer)

List of stakeholders:

1. Developer Frontend
2. THD Marketing group
3. THD Press Group
4. User Guest
5. User Staff (incl. Professors)
6. Developer (Frontend and Backend?)
